# SQL-Portfolio-Project
# About the Project
In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of food and data, leveraging SQL to analyze and gain insights from the extensive Zomato dataset. The dataset provided a wealth of information about restaurants, cuisines, user reviews, ratings, and more.

Using SQL queries, I explored various aspects of the dataset, including:

Exploratory Analysis: I investigated the distribution of restaurants across different locations, analyzed popular cuisines, and identified trends in user reviews and ratings.

Data Cleaning: I performed data cleaning operations, addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset's reliability and quality.

Aggregations and Summaries: I utilized SQL's aggregate functions to calculate average ratings, find the highest-rated restaurants, and derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Joins and Relationships: I explored the relationships between different tables in the dataset, such as linking restaurants with user reviews or identifying the most common cuisines in a particular location.

Advanced SQL Queries: I applied advanced SQL techniques to perform complex queries, including subqueries, nested queries, and window functions, to gain deeper insights and answer specific analytical questions.

The project's end-to-end nature means that I provided a comprehensive analysis, from data ingestion and cleaning to exploratory analysis and insightful findings. I also created visualizations to present the results in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.

I invite you all to explore my GitHub repository, where you can access the project code, documentation, and the Zomato dataset. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as I continue to enhance and refine this data analysis project.

Let's embark on a culinary journey with data using SQL and the Zomato dataset!
